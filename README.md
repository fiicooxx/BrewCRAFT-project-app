Warehouse management project application
## About us!
Hi! 👋 We are students of Computer Science from WSEI Kraków who have just started their journey with C#, xaml and SQL. 
This is our first project application in WPF. Check this out! 
## About the project
The main intetnion was to have some fun with creating UI in xaml and understanding the logic of buttons, events.
We have learned how to connect a database to a WPF app on .NET and make simple operations on queries.
## How does it look like?
